## üß† Team & Approach

### Team Name:  
`Hustlers`

### Team Members:  
- Aaditya Kumar (https://www.linkedin.com/in/aaditya-kumar-3176061a9 / Frontend Developer & UI/UX Designer)  
- Srijal Kumar  (https://github.com/nerd-Codes / https://www.linkedin.com/in/srijal-kumar / Lead Backend Developer & Release Engineer)
- Ritesh Kumar  (https://github.com/ritesh319 / www.linkedin.com/in/ritesh-kumar-aa69b2289 / Backend Developer & Deployment Engineer)

### Our Approach:

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### Core Technologies Used:
- Frontend: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MathJax
- Backend: Flask, Gunicorn, Python logging
- OCR: pix2tex, pytesseract, Pillow 
- APIs: Groq API
- Speech-to-Text : OpenAI Whisper

### Sponsor Technologies Used (if any):
- [‚úÖ] **Groq:** _We integrated the Groq API as the core large language model (LLM) engine for mathematical problem solving and explanation. Groq‚Äôs ultra-fast inference and support for advanced models
  (llama-3.3-70b-versatile) enabled our app to provide users with instant, step-by-step solutions and clear explanations for a wide range of math queries._  
- [ ] **Monad:** _Your blockchain implementation_  
- [ ] **Fluvio:** _Real-time data handling_  
- [ ] **Base:** _AgentKit / OnchainKit / Smart Wallet usage_  
- [ ] **Screenpipe:** _Screen-based analytics or workflows_  
- [ ] **Stellar:** _Payments, identity, or token usage_
